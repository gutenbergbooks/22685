<p class="example">Classification lies at the foundation of the mental processes. Without the power
of perceiving, recognizing resemblances, distinguishing differences in things, phenomena
and notions, grouping them mentally according to those resemblances and
differences, judgment is impossible, nor could reason be exercised in proceeding
from the known to the unknown.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The facilitation and abbreviation of mental labor is at the bottom of all mental
progress. The reasoning faculties of Newton were not different in qualitative character
from those of a ploughman; the difference lay in the extent to which they were
exerted and the number of facts which could be treated. Every thinking being
generalizes more or less, but it is the depth and extent of his generalizations which
distinguish the philosopher. Now it is the exertion of the classifying and generalizing
powers which thus enables the intellect of man to cope in some degree with the
infinite number and variety of natural phenomena and objects. (Jevons, Principles
of Science.)</p>


<h3 class="subsection">PAST CLASSIFICATIONS OF UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.</h3>

<p>As under the patent laws the people of the United States assume
all the risks in granting a patent for any means of the "useful arts,"
a classification that will facilitate a judgment respecting the patentability
of any means presented to the Patent Office is of peculiar
moment. The enormous extent, diversity, and refinement of the
useful arts preclude the formation of a judgment on novelty within a
reasonable time, unless the necessary comparisons with known processes
and instruments have been previously made along the lines
that searches must follow and the results of such comparisons made
available in a classification. The vast majority of available disclosures
of the arts occur in patents. Hence the Patent Office
classification must be adjusted in the main to the analysis, diagnosis,
and orderly arrangement of the disclosures of patents.</p>

<p>For more than 80 years United States patents have been classified.
The first published classification, promulgated in 1830, comprised
6,170 patents, divided into 16 classes. The change from a registration
to an examination system in 1836 instigated a new classification in 22
classes, including 9,800 patents. The next came in 1868 with 36
classes, including about 75,000 patents. On March 1, 1872, a revised
classification was adopted, comprising 145 classes, including 131,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">p. 2</a></span>
patents. This classification is said to have been planned by Dr.
Edward H. Knight. The placing of the patents in accordance with
the schedule of classes is said to have been done by the several
examiners. The class arrangement was purely alphabetical by class
titles, and the number designations followed the alphabetical order.
The names of things to be found in the several classes were arranged
alphabetically under each class title. No attempt was made to
bring the titles of allied materials into juxtaposition or to effect other
definite arrangement with reference to subject matter in the printed
schedules. A consolidated name index supplemented the list of
names by classes.</p>

<p>This classification of 1872 is in part the classification that now
exists, many of the same class numbers and titles being still in use.
Examiners were apparently permitted to make changes in classification
to suit their convenience without notice until 1877. In that
year a revision of the published schedule was made by a committee,
resulting in the addition of 13 new classes, and examiners were
ordered to transfer patents in accordance with the new titles. The
first classification published with distinct subclasses appeared in 1880.
From that time until 1898 the classification grew by addition and
subdivision of classes to suit the ends of individual examiners or in
response to supposed exigencies of the work where one division was
thought to be overloaded and another underloaded, and the alphabetical
arrangement of subclasses under each class has succeeded the
alphabetical list of names. The arbitrary correspondence originally
established between the alphabetical order of class titles and the
numerical order was destroyed as soon as expansion of the classification
began.</p>

<p>However suitable to the then-existing material of the useful arts
the classification of 1872 may have been, it failed as fail all inductive
processes wherein the generalizations are not broad and deep. (Isaac
Newton's intellect could detect the resemblance between the falling
fruit and the motions of the planets.) The classification of 1872 was
not exhaustive; it failed to recognize to the fullest extent what
Bishop Wilkins saw nearly 300 years ago, to wit, that there are "arts
of arts;" and it failed to provide for future invention of new species
in the same art, and to recognize that new arts could be formed from
combinations of the old.</p>


<h3 class="subsection">BEGINNING OF REVISION.</h3>

<p>The Classification Division was created in the hope that guiding
principles of classification could be developed and applied for the
purpose of amending or revising the classification whereby patents
could be placed with greater assurance, and whereby the searcher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">p. 3</a></span>
with these guiding principles in mind might find the nearest references.
It was confronted with the problem of revising while at the
same time keeping accurate record of all changes, correcting all
indexes of patents, and using copies in constant demand for search
at the same time, necessitating much clerical work, and constant
interruption&mdash;of correcting rather than planning anew; of mending
a machine while constantly increasing duty was required of it.</p>

<p>Ideas on the subject of revision were called for by the Commissioner
of Patents, and all in the Patent Office had an opportunity
to set forth their notions. The views of one met with approval and in
accordance with those views a "Plan of Classification" was prepared
and promulgated in 1900. What other plans may have been submitted
is not now generally known. But in substantial accordance
with that published plan, the process of revision has proceeded for
more than 14 years until approximately 50 per cent of the patents
(including incomplete work) have been placed in revised classes.</p>


<h3 class="subsection">PRECEDENTS AND AUTHORITIES.</h3>

<p>No effective precedents have been found in any prior classifications
of the arts. The classifications of the principal foreign patent offices
have not been materially different in principle from the United
States Patent Office classifications of the past.</p>

<p>The divisions found suitable for book classification for library use,
have not been deemed adequate to the exactness and refinement
essential to a patent office classification of the useful arts. The systems
of class and subclass sign or number designations of the modern
library classifications, with their mnemonic significance, afford the
most important suggestions to be drawn from library classification.
None of these systems of designation has been adopted, (1) because
of a serious doubt as to the availability of such designations by
reason of the length or unwieldiness to which they would attain in
the refinements of division necessary in a patent office classification,
and (2) because of the enormous amount of labor necessary to make
the change from present practice.</p>

<p>The best analogies are in the known (but changing) classifications
of the natural sciences, and in them the problems are so different
that they can serve only to illustrate general principles. The broad
principles of classification are well understood. The authorities are
the logicians from the ancient Aristotle to the modern Bentham,
Mill, and Jevons. The effort of the Classification Division has been
to adapt and apply these well-known principles to the enormously
diversified useful arts, particularly as disclosed in patents and applications
for patents.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">p. 4</a></span></p>


<h3 class="subsection">DEFINITION OF SCIENTIFIC CLASSIFICATION.</h3>

<p>It may be well to insert here an authoritative definition: "A scientific
classification is a series of divisions so arranged as best to facilitate
the complete and separate study of the several groups which are
the result of the divisions as well as of the entire subject under investigation."
(Fowler, Inductive Logic.)</p>

<p>Investigation and study of any subject will be facilitated if the
facts or materials pertinent to that subject be so marshaled and
arranged that those most pertinent to it may appear to the mind in
some form of juxtaposition. It is the purpose of the Patent Office
classification to divide and arrange the body and multitudinous units
of the useful arts so that, having the question of novelty of any defined
means to answer, one may with reasonable assurance approach that
portion of the rank of arts in which it will be found if it is not new,
and in propinquity to which will also be found those means that bear
the closest resemblances to that sought for, the resemblances of other
units growing less in proportion to their distance therefrom.</p>

<p>Success in the fundamental aim of facilitating adequate search
should evidently at the same time reduce proportionately the danger
that interfering applications will be overlooked and also effect a distribution
of labor favorable to the acquisition of special skill.</p>

<h2 class="section"><a name="B" id="B"></a>(B) PRINCIPLES OF THE NEW CLASSIFICATION OF THE PATENT OFFICE.</h2>

<h3 class="subsection">THE ELEMENTS OF A PATENT OFFICE CLASSIFICATION.</h3>


<p>A classification will be useful in proportion (1) to the pertinence to
the subject under investigation of the facts selected to be grouped
together, or, in other words, in proportion to the appropriateness of
the "basis of classification" to the subject in hand; (2) to the convenience,
stability, and uniformity of the arrangement of the subdivisions
whereby the investigator may proceed with reasonable
assurance to that portion of the rank of groups within which he will
find cognate material; (3) to the accuracy and perspicuity of the
definitions of the several divisions and subdivisions; (4) to the completeness
and reliability of the cross-referencing and cross-notations;
(5) to the uniformity, feasibility, and certainty of the rules by which
the accessions of patents disclosing one or several inventions may be
diagnosed and distributed to the appropriate divisions of the classification
in accordance with the basis adopted.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the foregoing analysis the theory of Patent Office
classification may be treated in five parts: (1) The principles on
which the arts shall be divided (basis of classification); (2) subdivision
and mechanical arrangement of groups; (3) definition; (4) cross-referencing
and search-notes; (5) the choice of features by which a
patent shall be assigned in the classification (diagnosis).</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">p. 5</a></span></p>

<h4 class="subsection">BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION.</h4>

<p>The first and most vital factor in any system of classification is the
basis of division, that is, the kind of characteristics common to any
number of objects selected to characterize groups, whereby the individuals
of any group will resemble each other for the purpose in
view more closely than any individual in any group will resemble
any individual in any other group.</p>

<p>"There is no property of objects which may not be taken, if we
please, as the foundation for a classification or mental grouping of
those objects, and in our first attempts we are likely to select for that
purpose properties which are simple, easily conceived, and perceptible
in a first view without any previous process of thought&mdash;but these
classifications are seldom much adapted to the ends of that classification
which is the subject of our present remarks." (J. S. Mill,
System of Logic.)</p>

<p>It is clear that a number of objects may be classified on several
different bases. For example, a number of books could be divided
into groups (1) according to the subject of their contents; (2) according
to the language in which the books are written; (3) according to
the size of page; (4) according to the binding material; or (5) according
to the color of the binding. Each of these may be useful classifications
for some purpose. For the student of literature none is of
value except the first; for the connoisseur in bindings, only the last
three. A classification of animals including classes of land animals
and water animals would hardly suit a student of zoology, as it would
associate with the shad and perch such differently organized creatures
as the porpoise, whale, and seal. Yet such a classification might
prove very suitable for a student of fisheries.</p>

<p><i>Art as a basis.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;So in seeking a basis for a patent office classification
the purposes of the classification should be the guide. Allegations
of ulterior uses<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (such as may be made merely because the inventor
thought of applying his invention to those uses only, or in an
effort to get the application examined in a certain division) and other
superficial bases should be avoided. That basis will best suit the
purpose which effects such an arrangement as will exhibit in suitable
groups the "state of the prior art," by which is here meant not necessarily
all the instruments of a trade or industry, or all the articles
sold by a shopkeeper, as a stationer, but those means that achieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">p. 6</a></span>
similar results by the application of similar natural laws<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to similar
substances.</p>

<p>As all inventions are made with the ultimate object of satisfying
some human desire, the utility of an invention appears to be a natural
basis of classification. It is apparent, however, that most inventions
may contribute to numerous utilities besides the ultimate one. Many
processes and instruments intervene between the seed planter and
the wheaten rolls upon the breakfast table. The plow may be viewed
as an agricultural instrument or as an instrument of civil engineering,
according as it is used for preparing the field for planting or rounding
a road. A radiating coil of pipe may be thought of as a condenser
of steam or of alcoholic vapors, according as it is applied to one material
or another; as a cooler or a heater, according to the temperature of
a fluid circulated through it. A hammer may drive nails, forge iron,
crack stone or nuts. Underlying all of these ulterior utilities, there
is a fundamental one to which the normal mind will reach in its
natural processes and there rest. The plow loosens or turns over the
surface of earth; the coil effects an exchange of heat between its interior
and exterior; the hammer strikes a blow. A classification of
plows in agriculture, road building, or excavating, according to stated
ultimate use; of a radiator coil as a steam condenser, still, jacket-water
cooler, refrigerator, or house heater; of the hammer as a forging
tool, a nail driver, or a nut cracker, appears to separate things
that are essentially alike. But classifying a plow on its necessary
function of plowing, a radiator on its necessary function of exchanging
heat, a hammer on its necessary function of striking a blow, evidently
results in getting very similar things together. Assuming for
the moment that utility is a reasonable basis of division of the useful
arts, it is deemed more logical to adopt as a basis some utility that
<i>must</i> be effected by the means under consideration when put to its
normal use rather than some utility that <i>may</i> be effected under <i>some</i>
conditions. Two of the five predictables of ancient logic are property<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and accident.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The capacity of the hammer to strike a blow, the
capacity of the radiator coil to exchange heat, are in the nature of
properties. The capacity of the hammer to crack nuts, of the coil to
condense steam, are in the nature of accidents&mdash;something that follows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">p. 7</a></span>
from the impact and the heat exchange because of the particular
accidental conditions of operation. To select an accident as a basis
of classification is contrary to the laws of thought.</p>

<p>It may be said then that the Patent Office classification is based
upon "art" in the strict sense in which the word may be said to be
used in section 4886, Revised Statutes, but not necessarily in the
looser sense of industries and trades. A proper maintenance of the
distinction between the word "arts" of the statute and the phrase
"industrial arts" used in the sense of industries and trades is essential
to an effective classification for the purposes of a patent office search.
Similar instruments have been patented in three different classes, because
of the statements that one was designed for cooling water, another
for heating water, another for sterilizing milk; in four different
classes, because of the statements that one apparatus was to separate
solids from the gases discharged from a metallurgical furnace, another
to separate carbon from the combustion gases of a steam-boiler
furnace, another to remove dust and tar from combustible gas, and
another to saturate water with carbon dioxid. Owing to the continuance
of a classification based largely on remote use, many applications
come into the office setting forth inventions of very general
application which nevertheless have to be classified more or less arbitrarily
in one of several arts in which they may be used but to which
they are not limited.</p>

<p><i>Function or effect as a basis.</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;Means of the useful arts are related in
different degrees. Resemblances selected as bonds for a number of
inventions may be more or less close. It is axiomatic that close resemblances
should be preferred over looser ones for classification purposes.
Processes and instruments for performing general operations,
such as moving, cutting, molding, heating, treating liquids with gases,
assembling, etc., are more closely bonded than those for effecting the
diverse separate successive operations directed toward complex
special results, such as making shoes, buttons, nails, etc. Means of
the former sort perform an essentially unitary act&mdash;the application
of a single force, the taking advantage of a single property of matter.
Those of the latter sort require the application of several different
acts employing frequently a plurality of forces or taking advantage
of several properties of matter. In the former case, classification can
be based on what has been called function, in the latter it cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">p. 8</a></span>
based on function but can be based on what has been called effect
(or product).</p>

<p>Function is closely related to cause. It is an axiom of logic that
cause is preferable to effect as a basis of those classifications designed
for scientific research. Hence the functional basis is preferred in all
cases in which it can be applied. A condenser for the fumes of zinc
is much more like a condenser for the fumes of acid or the vapor of
water than it is like the art of recovering zinc from its ores, and it
employs only one principle, to wit, heat interchange. A water-jacket
for cooling the walls of a gas-producer or glass-furnace is much more
like a water-jacket for cooling the walls of a limekiln or steam-boiler
furnace than it is like the art of gas-making or manufacture of glass
articles. In accordance with what are thought to be the correct
principles, therefore, the zinc-condenser ought not to be classified as a
part of the art of metallurgy, nor the water-jacket as a part of the art
of gas-making, merely because these instruments have a use in
these arts, but should be included, respectively, in classes based upon
the more fundamental utilities effected by them.</p>

<p>Although it is evident that molding a button is more like molding a
door-knob than it is like making buttons by the combined operations
of sawing, grinding, turning, and drilling, wherefore the molding of
buttons should be classified in a general plastic art rather than in a
special button-making art, yet the making of buttons by a plurality
of different kinds of operations can be placed only in a class based
upon the product, to wit, button-making. Since, therefore, the combination
of many different operations for the production of a specific
article can not be classified on the basis of any single function, it must
be classified on the basis of product. Thus by selecting essential
function as a basis when possible, and resulting effect when the functional
basis is not possible, one may approximate to the correct classification
described by Herbert Spencer as follows: "A true classification
includes in each class those objects that have more characteristics
in common with one another than any of them have with objects
excluded from the class."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>So it is deemed better to classify in accordance with the function
or effect it is known a means <i>must</i> perform or accomplish than in
accordance with the <i>object</i> with respect to which an act or acts are
directed or in accordance with some <i>effect</i> which may or may not result.</p>

<p><i>Structure as a basis.</i>&mdash;The phrase "structural classification" is frequently
made use of. The application of the phrase to processes is
manifestly absurd. The Patent Office never had a structural classification
except in a limited sense. How could a machine, for example,
be classified on structure, leaving out of consideration its function
and the effect of its normal operation? In the refinements of subdivision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">p. 9</a></span>
however, it becomes frequently desirable to form minor
subdivisions on structural differences. And it may also be that
instruments will be presented for classification that are of such general
utility as to baffle the efforts of the intellect to attain to the fundamental
and necessary function, in which case a structure-defined
class may best suit the needs of classification.</p>

<p>As between a classification based upon structure and one based
upon utility, the choice has been for the latter, without prejudice,
however, to instances that may arise in favor of the former.</p>

<p>The subject of structural classification will be dropped with a
quotation from the original pamphlet "Plan of Classification," etc.
(p. 5): "A purely 'structural' classification is almost impossible on
account of the infinite variety of mechanical combinations, and to
attempt it would probably result in utter confusion, for the classes
could not be defined, and the classification would be a mere digest of
mechanical elements having no community of function."</p>


<h4 class="subsection">DIVISION AND ARRANGEMENT.</h4>

<p>Having divided the aggregate of things to be classified into a large
number of groups on a satisfactory basis, a most useful work will have
been accomplished and the purpose of a classification to assemble
the things most nearly alike and separate them from other things will
have been partially achieved. Unless these numerous groups are
arranged in some definite understandable relation to each other, or are
placed in definite known positions where they can be found, the mere
formation of the groups, on however good a basis, is not a complete
classification. Furthermore, unless the position of each group with
respect to those other groups that resemble it in whole or in part is
made known, he who wishes to find other related matter must seek
aimlessly with no assurance that his quest will end until the whole
series shall have been investigated. Each classified group is metaphorically
a pigeonhole to contain similar material. If the pigeonholes
are properly labeled, one can ultimately locate those that contain
the matter he is seeking if he knows the name that has been applied to
it. If the pigeonholes are arranged in alphabetical order, for example,
he may find all related material, <i>provided he knows the name of every
related group of material</i>, even though very similar things may bear
names as far apart as A and Z. But if all things were so placed that,
adjacent and in certain fixed relation to each pigeonhole, other related
matter could be found, the resemblances lessening in proportion to
the separation, and if the entire area of pigeonholes were divided,
and certain areas assigned to certain kinds of things defined in general
terms, guessing the location of and desultory search for things that
may have different names, but yet be very much alike, would be lessened
and all cognate material be bunched. A second vital factor of a
system of classification, therefore, is the arrangement of the groups.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">p. 10</a></span></p>

<p><i>Infinitude of possible combinations.</i>&mdash;There are now over 1,125,000
United States patents, each presumptively covering a creation of the
useful arts that is different from every other. Most of these patents
also disclose a plurality of elements or acts. Each of these patented
means is potentially an element of a more complex combination that
may be patented. When one considers merely the number of forms
of energy, the number of known substances and known mechanical
elements, and attempts to figure possible combinations and permutations,
it becomes apparent that the size of the numbers resulting is
incomprehensible. Consider the possibilities of combination also of
the enormously varied disclosures of patents. Calculations of the
possible combinations and permutations of a small number of objects
are familiar. Different combinations of the letters of the alphabet
are sufficient to record the sum of human knowledge in many languages.
With substantially two octaves of the diatonic scale the
world's melodies have been sounded, nor do any doubt that our
successors will thrill to airs that we have never heard. "Thirty
metals may be combined into 435 binary alloys, 4,060 ternary alloys,
27,405 quaternary alloys" (Jevons). This does not take into consideration
differences in proportion that figure so largely in results in
the arts of substance-making. The total number of possible alloys
of the known metals is incomprehensible. A moment's thought
respecting the numbers of the means of the useful arts will alleviate
any fears that the possibilities of invention are near the limit and
will give food for further thought to all concerned with this attempt
to classify the useful arts to the point of refinement necessary to
enable this office to pass judgment with reasonable speed and accuracy
upon the approximately 75,000 applications filed each year.</p>

<p><i>Division and arrangement in the natural sciences.</i>&mdash;Some of the
natural sciences are said to be in what is known as the classificatory
stage of development. In some sciences the subject of classification
has been predominant and these furnish excellent examples of scientific
classification.</p>

<p>The much-admired classifications of zoology, botany, and mineralogy
are among the best available models of logical division,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> systematic
and analytical arrangement. The most casual consideration
of these classifications, however, renders apparent the relative simplicity
of the task of classifying natural objects differentiated by
fixed natural laws as compared with the task of classifying the
products of the creative and imaginative faculties as applied to the
useful arts. The chimera and other animal monsters occur only as
figments of the mind. Zoological classification does not have to
classify combinations of birds, fishes, reptiles, and mammals, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">p. 11</a></span>
does it deal in the way of classification with the parts of animals,
nor is the question of absolute numbers of instances a matter of
moment to such a classification, all of the members of a species being
alike for classification purposes. But any instrument of the useful
arts may be combined with some other, any part with some other
part. Organizations may be parts of some other organizations, or
even mutually parts of each other, as, for example, a pump may be a
part of a lubricator, or a lubricator may be a part of a pump. Some
parts are peculiar to one instrument, some are common to many.
Every member of a species differs from every other member. Added
to this, the intellectual differences between the persons who present
the applications for patent, the differences in their generalizing
powers, the relatively broad and narrow views of two or more persons
presenting the same invention (variations not indulged in by
nature) complicate the problem of classifying the useful arts.</p>

<p><i>Difficulty of entitling a subclass corresponding to every combination.</i>&mdash;In
any main class or group of the useful arts there are always a
number of characteristics that it may be desirable to take note of in
subdivision titles. A moment's thought shows the impossibility of
taking care of any large number of combined characteristics so as to
provide exactly for each combination, for the reason that the limitations
of space and of the perceptive faculties forbid. For a simple
illustration, the imaginary classification of books for use by a bookseller
may be recurred to. The dealer, it may be assumed, has books
on (1) four different subjects, history, science, art, and fiction, (2)
each printed in four languages, English, German, French, Spanish,
(3) in four different sizes of page, folio, quarto, octavo, duodecimo,
(4) bound in four materials, leather, rawhide, cloth, paper. Here
are four main characteristics, each in four varieties. A customer is
likely to ask for Ivanhoe in English, octavo, bound in leather. Now
if the bookseller had sought to arrange the books into one class according
to subject matter, into another according to language, another
according to size, another according to binding, he would have
fallen into confusion, because his classes would be formed on different
principles or bases and overlap. Some histories will be in French,
some will have octavo pages, and some cloth bindings. But if he
divides first on the basis of subject matter, then each subject matter
into language, each language book into sizes, each size into material
of binding, he can immediately place his hand on a class wherein the
book will be if he has it; but this classification, based on four different
characteristics and four varieties of each, has necessitated the
formation of 256 classes or divisions, and if five characteristics were
provided for, 1,024 divisions would be required.</p>

<p>Adapting the illustration of the books to a patent office classification:
If it were possible to view these characteristics as patentable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">p. 12</a></span>
in combinations of all or in any combinations less than all, and also
as separate characteristics, 16 divisions additional to the 256 for
each independent characteristic would have to be provided, as well
as other divisions for combinations of less than the whole, in order
to make the classification absolutely indicative of every feature,
and the number of divisions would be enormous. In such a classification,
after the proper division had been located, the search
would be nothing, the difficulty would be to find the appropriate
class.</p>

<p><i>Expedients to reduce the number of subdivisions.</i>&mdash;Fortunately most
people carry on their mental processes in accordance with certain
uniformities. Under this uniformity of thought no patentable
relationship may be alleged between a quarto volume and the subject
of history or between a leather binding and the German language;
wherefore 4 classes of coordinate value, based on the 4 characteristics,
each divided into 4 subclasses, 16 divisions in all, may serve the
purpose of a Patent Office search. But if, as sometimes happens,
a patentable relationship had been assumed and admitted between
a leather binding and any of the languages, or any of the subjects, or
between any two or more of those different characteristics, provision
could be made for such combinations by the following expedients:</p>

<p>(1) Arrange the characteristics, in the order of relative significance
or importance for the purpose in view, in four groups, giving
each group the characteristic title. Under each title arrange the
varieties in a similar relation as follows in either (1) or (2):</p>

<p>Subject-matter, assumed to be the most important characteristic,
is placed first. Any exhibit of mere material for binding, mere size,
mere language, or mere subject-matter, would fall into the correspondingly
entitled group. If, however, a book on history in German
or a history in red leather, etc., were to be classified, it would
be placed in subclass "History" in the subject-matter group, and a
French book in green cloth would be placed in subclass "French" in
the language group. That is, combinations of any characteristic with
any one or more other characteristics may be placed in the group
for that characteristic deemed the most significant and which is
highest in the schedule. Again, by assigning a number to each
generic title, each such title becomes thereby the miscellaneous group
for varieties other than those indented under it, as well as for all
varieties associating any characteristic with one or more of those
standing lower down. Thus, a book of poems would belong in
subclass "Subject-matter" and a 16mo volume bound with purple
celluloid covers would belong in subclass "Size." So, by giving
meaning to relative position, exhaustive arrangement is sought to
be provided in a reasonable number of groups. To provide for other
features that may be presented in future, an additional miscellaneous
group may be added at the top (1), or the class title (2) might
be deemed to represent the unclassified residue and a depository for
future matter not specifically provided for.</p>

<p>(2) If the number of instances of association of subject-matter and
binding materials, language and size, etc., are numerous, additional
groups might be placed above the groups having the names of the
characteristics, the fact of the existence of these groups indicating
that the characteristic groups are for single characteristics only and
do not include books having several different ones. In such case the
schedule might be headed by a miscellaneous group, having either the
title "Miscellaneous" or the title of the class, to receive associated
characteristics not provided for by specific titles, immediately followed
by subclasses for the particular associations found to be most
numerous, as follows:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">books.</span></p>
<div class="ctrclass">
<ul class="lsoff">

<li>Miscellaneous.</li>
<li>Subject-matter and language.</li>
<li>Subject-matter and binding material.</li>
<li>Subject-matter.</li>
<li>Language.</li>
<li>Size.</li>
<li>Binding material.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>To illustrate further, selecting for the purpose a mass of objects
presenting problems more nearly like those presented to the office in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">p. 14</a></span>
questions of patentability, let it be assumed that one is to classify
the objects in a heap of metal scrap.</p>

<p>On looking over the material of the heap it is noticed that there
are a large number of metal balls; some have holes through them,
some are hollow, some are smooth on the outside, and some are
hollow, smooth, and perforated, but they are all nevertheless balls,
and accordingly all balls can be separated out and placed in a heap
by themselves. Next, the presence of bars in the general mass is
observed, some long, some short, some straight, some twisted, some
of round stock, some of square stock, etc. These may be gathered
together and placed in a separate pile at the left of the balls. It is
further observed that there are many differently shaped annular
bodies in the heap resembling generally the single links of a chain,
some circular, some elliptical, some twisted, some made of round
stock, some of square stock, etc. They are all nevertheless annular
bodies; these may be placed in a separate pile at the left of the bars.</p>

<p>Now, in the remnant of the original heap, a sufficient number of
similar single elements does not remain from which to make a smaller
pile of elements. Different combinations of links, balls, and bars
are, however, observed in the remaining heap. Some are combinations
of links, some combinations of a ball and link, some of a bar
and link, and some of a bar, link, and ball. These different combinations
may be separated out in the order named and placed in
separate piles. After all these things have been removed, there is
left in the original heap a number of odds and ends or miscellaneous
metal objects.</p>

<p>These several groups may now be arranged in the inverse order in
which (in the particular illustration adopted) they have been removed,
thus:</p>

<div class="lclass">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Miscellaneous (remnants of the original heap of scrap).</li>
<li>Combined bar, link, and ball.</li>
<li>Combined bar and link.</li>
<li>Combined bar and ball.</li>
<li>Combined link and ball.</li>
<li>Chains.</li>
<li>Links.</li>
<li>Bars.</li>
<li>Balls.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Knowing that objects of metal scrap not covered by the specific
titles will be found in the miscellaneous group, and that the more
complex specifically-named things are to be found first after the
miscellaneous or at the left of the row of piles of materials thus
separated and arranged, and the more simple things and parts
farther to the right, the particular piles to resort to for the things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">p. 15</a></span>
wanted may be definitely determined. The same processes may be
applied to each of the piles. Thus, balls, in the above illustration,
may be divided into&mdash;</p>

<div class="ctrclass">
<ul class="eclass">
<li>Balls&mdash;
<ol class="eclass">
<li>10. Hollow perforated.</li>
<li>11. Hollow grooved.</li>
<li>12. Hollow.</li>
<li>13. Perforated.</li>
<li>14. Grooved.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Again, the same processes may be applied to a mass of more
diversified junk, of which the metal scrap may form one pile, rags
another, old bricks another, old timber another, and, still another,
timber having metal-straps, bolts, nails, etc., connected with it.</p>

<p><i>Superiority and inferiority.</i>&mdash;In the arrangement of subclasses in a
class, those groups that are related to each other as wholes and parts
are arranged so that the wholes shall stand before the parts, and so
that subclasses defined by effect or by special use shall stand before
those defined by function or general use. For example, in the scrap
illustration above, assuming the titles to be in a printed arrangement,
"chains" precedes "links," which may be parts of chains, and if it
had been desired to separate animal-drags, for instance, from the
scrap, some animal-drags being particular adaptations of a bar, links,
and ball, the group of animal-drags should precede "Bar, link, and
ball." The words "superior" and "inferior" have been used to indicate
this relationship. A class or subclass defined to receive a certain
combination is superior to one defined to receive an element or a
combination that is a part of that certain combination. A class or
subclass defined to receive means for making a particular product, as
an electric lamp, is superior to a class or subclass designed to perform
a general function, as pumping air from a container. And whenever
a question of assignment of a patent or application that contains
matters of two or more groups bearing that relation is raised, the
"superior" group is selected to receive it.</p>

<p>Further, in those instances in which groups are formed on different
bases or different characteristics, not comparable with each other,
and a patent is presented having matter falling in each group, that
group which is highest in position is preferred in those instances
where separate provision for means having both characteristics has
not been made.</p>

<p>In cases of necessity, as where a combination is presented for
which no class has been definitely provided, but classes exist into
which the several parts would fall if separately claimed, the same
practice that obtains in similar situations with respect to two or
more <i>subclasses</i> of a class may be followed with respect to two or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">p. 16</a></span>
more <i>classes</i> and the patent placed in that class which, in accordance
with above-stated principles, should be deemed the "superior."</p>

<p><i>Definite positional relationship of subdivisions.</i>&mdash;In the metal scrap
example, above, division has been effected on the one basis of form
or contour. If it had been desired to separate also on material, for
example, if it were deemed important to locate all brass scrap, each
of the groups based upon form could be divided into one of <i>brass</i> and
one <i>not brass</i>, or the entire heap could be divided into <i>brass</i> and <i>not
brass</i>, and under the heading "brass" could be indented the various
articles made of brass, and under "not brass" the various articles not
made of brass, and this would double the number of divisions. If
also it were desired to separate the lead articles in the same manner
the number of classes would be tripled. But, as in the book illustration,
it may be impracticable thus to multiply subdivisions, and
the basis "form" having been selected as of <i>first-rank</i> importance, all
divisions based upon form should be completed and kept together.
Then, "material," having been selected as of <i>second-rank</i> importance,
should be carried out with respect to all objects in which form is non-essential.
If enough brass balls were found to render it advisable to
make a subdivision of them, they should be assembled into a subclass
indented under "balls" and not into a subclass indented under
"brass." Having selected one basis as <i>primary</i>, it should never
subsequently be made <i>secondary</i> or <i>vice versa</i>. Some such restriction
on modes of division appears salutary in a system of divisions designed
to definitely limit search. The arrangement herein sought to be
explained is susceptible of use to limit all searches for a single definitely
stated invention to a subclass properly entitled to receive it
or those indented under it, and to those subclasses above, which
may include it as a part of an organization or specialized means.</p>

<p>As between coordinate groups divided on the same basis, there is
no question of superiority and inferiority. The terms "superior" and
"inferior" are useful in questions of relationship between combinations
and subcombinations or elements thereof, and between groups
founded on effect or product and those founded on simple function.
The mere difference in complexity of mutually exclusive coordinate
groups involves no relationship of superiority or inferiority. A subclass
to receive a screw-cutting lathe is superior to a subclass to
receive a lathe-headstock, a locomotive class is superior to a class to
receive steam-engines, for the reason that the lathe is a whole of
which the headstock is a part, and the locomotive is an organization
of which the engine is an element. But the headstock subclass is
not superior necessarily to the tailstock subclass simply because the
headstock is commonly more complex than the tailstock. Yet arbitrary
preference for classification in the headstock subclass may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">p. 17</a></span>
established by position where an application or a patent contains
claims for both.</p>

<p>Thus in a class that is founded on a well-chosen basis that brings
together things bearing close resemblances to each other, all types
that contain the elements essential to produce a complete practically
operative means will be found in subclasses that have a position
somewhere between the beginning and end of the list of subclasses of
the class. Those that add features of elaboration of the essential
types and those that are highly specialized to some particular purpose
within the definition of the class will stand above the essential
type subclasses, while those subclasses for parts and details will
stand below those for the essential types.</p>

<p><i>Indented schedules.</i>&mdash;In an indented schedule all subclasses in the
first column reading from the left are species to the genus represented
by the class title.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> All subclasses indented under another subclass
are species to the genus represented by the subclass under
which they are indented. If a title has no number, it represents
merely a subject-matter to be divided, a genus,&mdash;having no representatives
except in the species under it. If a subclass having a generic
title has a number, it not only represents a subject-matter to be
divided into species but also all other species not falling within the
titles indented. Although these relative positions might imply that
only proximate species are indented one place, yet mechanical difficulties
render it impracticable to so arrange that all species shall be
indented under their proximate genera.</p>

<p>Indention properly carried out has a tendency to prevent in the
process of logical division the logical fault of proceeding from a high
or broad genus to a low or narrow species. This latter fault may
inadvertently separate things that belong together. If, for example,
it were desired to divide balls in the stated illustration according to
material, an immediate division of balls into aluminum, zinc, glass,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">p. 18</a></span>
ivory, rubber, would be less useful than to divide into mineral
materials and nonmineral materials as follows:</p>

<div class="ctrclass">
<ul class="eclass">
 <li>Balls&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Mineral&mdash;

 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Nonmetallic&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Glass.</li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul>
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Metallic&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Aluminum.</li>
 <li>Zinc.</li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul>
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Nonmineral&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Vegetable&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Rubber.</li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul>
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Animal&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
 <li>Ivory.</li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul></li>
 </ul></li>

</ul>
</div>

<p>However, it is evident that indention carried to its full extant,
useful as it is in keeping analogous things together, would make the
printing of schedules complex and unwieldy. Nevertheless, in the
generalizing process necessary in logical division and arrangement,
the divisions of species should always be <i>mentally indented</i>, as it were,
under their <i>proximate</i> genera. Thus, under a genus unnamed may be
arranged several species in juxtaposition, without actually printing
the name of the genus, so that the schedule above may read:</p>

<div class="ctrclass">
<ul class="eclass">
 <li>Balls&mdash;
 <ul class="eclass">
  <li>Glass.</li>
  <li>Aluminum</li>
  <li>Zinc.</li>
  <li>Rubber.</li>
  <li>Ivory.</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In an arrangement printed in idea-order, though relegating the
genera mineral, nonmetallic, metallic, nonmineral, vegetable, animal,
to the mind unaided by printed words, the different species of the
same genus may be kept together except that species for which no
title has been provided must go back to the subclass under which the
named species are indented. Thus the arrangement above necessitates
placing in subdivision "Balls" all <i>copper</i> balls, whereas indention
under proximate genus "metal" would have brought all metal balls
together. In a finely divided classification, printing of titles for all
genera is not practicable; hence great care ought to be directed toward
grouping species according to the principles of arrangement herein
outlined, noting that whenever a change of basis is made, a new genus
is implied, and that subclasses for all other species of the same genus
under whatever name, must be brought into juxtaposition as if indented
under the implied genus.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">p. 19</a></span></p>

<p><i>Bifurcate division.</i>&mdash;Most discussions of classification make reference
to the so-called bifurcate scheme of division as the only one by
which exhaustive division can be surely achieved. This is commonly
illustrated by the ancient tree of Porphyry. By this method any
subject it is desired to subdivide is first divided by writing the name
of one selected species at one branch and writing at the other branch
the name of the same species prefixed by "Not." Thus the Agassiz
classification of living beings divides them first into sensible and not
sensible (plants). A botanical classification divides plants into
flowering and not flowering. A zoological classification divides
animals into vertebrate and not vertebrate. By continuing the
process of division in the same manner, the division is obviously
exhaustive of the subject, there being always a negative subdivision
to receive any subsequently created or discovered species. Although
bifurcate division has been ridiculed by some, it is agreed by highest
authority that it is the only plan of division by which one can be
sure to have a consistent place for everything, or by which one can
be certain that the divisions are mutually exclusive. It can be
demonstrated that a classification schedule in which the relation of
genera and species is shown by indentions, if correctly formed on
the principles now sought to be applied in the revision of the Patent
Office classification, is susceptible of conversion into a tree of
Porphyry, while unlike the latter it is compact and wieldy.</p>

<p><i>Utility of arrangement according to resemblances.</i>&mdash;The expedient of
indicating kinds of relationship between several equally indented
divisions by relative position has the following utility:</p>

<p>(1) A uniform rule is provided, applicable to all classes, for placing
inventions that bear the relation of whole to part in subdivisions before
those that bear the relation of a part to that whole, and those that are
defined by a particular effect, product, material, or use before those
that are defined by a function or an operation applicable generally
to various effects, products, materials, or uses; whereby that portion
of the schedule in which any invention belonging to any particular
class should be found may be approached whether or not the investigator
knows the name of the object sought for or the title of the
appropriate subdivision.</p>

<p>(2) The substantial impossibility of dividing many branches of
the useful arts exhaustively into a reasonable number of mutually
exclusive or non-overlapping subclasses is compensated for; so that
when the classifier or the searcher has an invention to place or to
find including two or more different kinds of characteristics, for each
of which a subdivision is provided, but no subdivision for the plural
characteristics, it will be known that the invention should be in the
subclass for that characteristic which stands before the subclass for
the other characteristic.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">p. 20</a></span></p>

<p>(3) It compensates for omission of some generic titles that if written
in the indented schedule would lengthen specific titles to a cumbersome
extent.</p>

<p>(4) It provides a rule for cross-referencing where several inventions
are claimed bearing to each other any of the relationships
indicated above, cross-referencing being necessary in one direction
only where the matter illustrated is coextensive with the matter
claimed.</p>

<p>(5) It definitely limits the field of search for any <i>unitary invention</i>
in any class so arranged, as no patented invention having the limitations
imposed by a unitary claim should be found in any subclass
below the subclass properly defined to receive it or those indented
under it. Parts of such inventions may be found below or following
this subclass in the same class if these parts are within the class
definition, or elsewhere in the useful arts if not within that definition.
The unitary invention may be found in the subclass limited to
it and certain subclasses arranged <i>above</i> or <i>before</i> it adapted to receive
organizations of which it may be a part.</p>

<p>A complete system of arrangement should comprise (1) a display
of the entire field of the useful arts in a manner to show the relation
of the larger as well as of the smaller groups,&mdash;carrying the appropriate
relationship as far as possible from the highest genera to the
lowest species, the arrangement being such as would bring materials
most nearly alike into closest propinquity regardless of the names
they may be called by. (2) Supplementary to this classification
arrangement by ideas there should be an alphabetical index of subclass
titles, appropriately cross indexed, and additional titles of
various technical and trade names of things classified under subclass
titles.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">DEFINITION.</h4>

<p>Definition is indispensable in any classification and is very difficult.
Every class must be defined and all of the groups under it. After
definitions have been made and printed, they are sometimes found
inadequate and must be supplemented by the definitions of other
classes. This is unavoidable while the complete material remains
unexplored. Definition in the strict logical sense is not to be expected,
nor is it necessary. It is commonly sufficient if an explanation or
comparison be made sufficient to direct the mind to the character of
the contents of the group and indicate its limitations. Hitherto four
of the five predicables of ancient logic have been mentioned, to wit,
genus, species, property, and accident. In connection with definition,
the fifth predicable, difference, is useful. To define a class, it is sufficient,
generally, for the purposes of office classification, to state a
<i>peculiar property</i> (not an accident) of the objects included in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">p. 21</a></span>
class; and to define a species under the class it is sufficient to state
the name of the class plus the difference&mdash;i. e., with the addition of the
limitations that characterize the species.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This procedure in definition
is susceptible of application from the highest genus to the lowest
species. It is advisable to define the means included within a title
without any introductory words, such as "this subclass includes
inventions relating to," etc., treating the subclass for definition purposes
as if it were a collection of concrete things, in the same manner
as in a dictionary definition.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">CROSS-REFERENCES AND SEARCH-NOTES.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></h4>

<p>If patents were in all respects like material objects, cross-references
and search-notes would not be necessary. Nails, screws, locks,
hinges, and boxes are distinct things susceptible of definite separation
and classification. Even though nails, screws, locks, and hinges
form part of the box, the box is still a box, not a nail, screw, hinge, or
lock. For the needs of the Patent Office classification, however,
although a patent for a box must be classified with boxes, yet if a
peculiar nail, screw, lock, or hinge is claimed in the same patent with
the box, or even if any one of these customary accessories of boxes is
illustrated, it may be necessary to provide copies of the patent for the
box in each of the several classes provided for nails, screws, locks,
or hinges.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as every relatively complex thing is made up of relatively
simple things, it is obvious that all disclosures can not be cross-referenced.
Any attempt to calculate the number of cross-references
to be supplied if all disclosures of the subjects of invention were to be
cross-referenced would show the number to be incalculable. It is
necessary, therefore, to leave to the judgment of the classifier the
propriety of cross-referencing unclaimed disclosures.</p>

<p>Should a patent contain a number of claims defining a number of
differently classifiable inventions, complete cross-referencing from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">p. 22</a></span>
the class in which the classification is made original into the other
appropriate classes or subclasses should be effected, <i>unless</i> cross-search
notes or arrangement of subclasses with appropriate titles may
be substituted to advantage.</p>

<p>Cross-referencing or cross-search notes are made, as a rule, from
combination class to element class, but never or very rarely from the
element class to the combination class in which it may be used. Thus
cross-referencing should normally be downward in a schedule of subclasses.
Search notes indicate parallel or otherwise related classes
and subclasses, and those classes and subclasses in which analogous
structures having different purposes but adapted to answer broad
claims may be found.</p>

<p>By arbitrary rules of arrangement such as have been referred to in
the section dealing with division and arrangement, a search may
ordinarily be definitely limited to a certain number of subclasses,
even where cross-references are not made. In such arrangement any
given patent, <i>if it be directed to one invention</i>, may be searched in the
subclass within which the definition places it or subclasses indented
under it, and in certain subclasses above, whose titles will indicate
that the invention might be included as a part of the matter defined
to belong therein, but it would never have to be searched in any
subclass following and not indented thereunder.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">DIAGNOSIS TO DETERMINE CLASSIFICATION.</h4>

<p>Each patent and each application discloses one or more means of
the useful arts (using the term "means" to cover both processes and
instruments in the sense in which it is used by Prof. Robinson),
almost always more than one, since most new means are combinations
of mechanical elements or acts. In some patents and applications
the disclosure is coextensive with that which is claimed; in
others there is matter disclosed but not claimed. The unclaimed
disclosure may be as valuable as the claimed disclosure for purposes
of anticipation, and the classification must provide for both. If the
claimed disclosure belongs in one class and the unclaimed in others,
the classifier must choose between two or more classes that one
in which the patent or application shall be classified and those into
which it shall be cross-referenced.</p>

<p><i>Claimed or unclaimed disclosure.</i>&mdash;The claims of a patent are the
statutory indices of that which the applicant believes to be new,
they define an invention that has been searched by the Patent Office
and no anticipation discovered for it. Future action must be based
on inductions from past experience; none knows what the future
lines of search will be; the only guides for future searches are the
searches of the past; the evidence of past searches is the claims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">p. 23</a></span>
of patents; they trace the course of invention. Furthermore, a
presumption of novelty attaches to the claimed matter; no such presumption
attaches to the unclaimed. The law requires every patent
for improvement to show so much of the old as is necessary to explain
the uses of the improvement. In practice much more than that is
disclosed. Questions as to the proper placing of patents and cross-references
would be diminished by the strict enforcement of Rule 36
of the Rules of Practice requiring that the description and the drawings,
as well as the claims, be confined to the specific improvement
and such parts as necessarily co&ouml;perate with it. In any event both
the claimed disclosure and that which is unclaimed must be taken
care of, one by cross-reference, and the disclosure selected for cross-reference
is that to which no presumption of novelty attaches.</p>

<p>This practice of placing patents by the claimed disclosure is sometimes
misunderstood. Its chief application is in determining classification
in case of disclosures involving a plurality of main classes.
Furthermore, the mere letter of the rule is not to be applied in
preference to its spirit. Subcombinations claimed may be placed
with the combinations, and in subordinate type subclasses patents
must be placed sometimes by claimed and sometimes by not-claimed
disclosures.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis of pending applications.</i>&mdash;What has been said relates to
patents. The bearing of the practice of adopting the claimed disclosure
as the basis of assignment of applications for examination
has also to be considered.</p>

<p>Two pending applications claiming the same means very commonly
differ in the kind and extent of disclosure. One application may
disclose several inventions. Which of the several disclosures shall be
selected as the mark by which to place the application? For instance,
the typical wire-nail machine has a wire-feeding mechanism, a shearing
mechanism, an upsetting (forging) mechanism, side-serrating
mechanism, and pointing mechanism; it may also have a counting
mechanism, a packaging mechanism, an electric motor on its frame
for furnishing power; and, in addition, numerous power-transmitting
and other machine parts, such as bearings, oil-cups, safety appliances,
etc. The applicant may have made a complete new organization of
nail-machine and may seek a patent for the total combination.
He may have invented a new shearing mechanism and have chosen
to show it thus elaborately in the place of use he had in mind, or he
may have designed a new counter or a new oil-cup or a new power
transmission, or even a new motor, and have given his invention
this elaborate setting. The shears, the counter, the oil-cup, the
power transmission, and the motor are separately classifiable in
widely separated classes. How shall the application be diagnosed
for determining its place in the office classification? When the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">p. 24</a></span>
specification and drawing disclose (as most of them do) several
subjects matter of invention, though claiming only one, which of
those several subjects matter shall control the classification?</p>

<p>The most natural procedure, at first thought, would be to classify
on the totality of the showing, in which case the application for the
nail-machine, supposed above, would be assigned to nail-making.
But imagine the invention claimed by an applicant to be the counter.
Then the examiner in charge of nail-making would have to search
the class of registers with which he is not familiar. Suppose applicant
No. 2 files an application for the same counter which he illustrates
and describes in connection with a bottle-filling machine, and
that, classifying on the totality of the showing, this goes to the
division that has the class of packaging liquids. Now both the
examiners in charge of bottle-filling and nail-making, knowing that
counters are classified in registers, search the class of registers and
also the pending applications in registers. After these examiners
have made their searches, suppose applicant No. 3 files an application
for the same counter, which he says may be used for counting
small articles produced by automatic machines. Perhaps he shows
the counter attached to a piece of conventional mechanism representing
any manufacturing machine, mentioning, say, a cigarette or
pill or cartridge-making machine. It has not occurred to either the
the examiner of nail-making or the examiner of bottle-filling that the
other might have any such application; nor does it occur to the
examiner in charge of registers to search nail-making or bottle-filling.
As the specification of the counter application mentions cigarette,
pill, and cartridge-making machines to which the counter may be
attached, the examiner in charge of registers may search those
classes. Suppose that the counter proves to be new, and each of the
three examiners allows a patent. Here now are three patents for
the same thing. Of course, after allowance, the counter and all
other disclosed inventions that give any suggestion of novelty are
cross-referenced; but the primary purpose of a patent office classification
(to aid in determining patentability) has failed in this instance.</p>

<p>In the imagined situation respecting pending applications, without
doubt diagnosis and classification upon the invention claimed is
necessary to effect the purpose of the office classification. Cross-referencing
after issue can not undo that which has been done.</p>

<p>If no application save that of the nail-machine be pending, no
duplication of patents occurs, but the labor of search is increased by
reason of the unfamiliarity of the examiner with the inventions he
has to search. After the patent is allowed he may find the entire
combination of the nail-machine without the counter disclosed in a
patent for a nail-making machine, so that as a nail-making machine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">p. 25</a></span>
this new patent is of no value as a reference. Very probably all of
the other inventions illustrated (except the counter) are also old in
their respective classes; but the examiner of nail-making can not
tell this without extensive searches in those classes, so he notes cross-references
for them all.</p>

<p><i>Difficulties due to varying ideas of claims.</i>&mdash;Very troublesome questions
are constantly arising as to whether an invention should be
classified in a combination class or an element class. The point
will be illustrated by example: A describes and illustrates an
automobile having an internal-combustion motor and a friction-clutch
in the motor transmission-gear. He states that the clutch is
in the usual relationship to the motor and gearing, but claims a
new clutch for whatever it may be adapted. B discloses an internal-combustion
motor said to be for automobiles with transmission-gearing
and a friction-clutch and claims "in an internal-combustion
motor a friction-clutch," etc., specifying the form of the
clutch. C makes the same disclosure, but claims "an internal-combustion
motor having a specified clutch," while D, with the same
disclosure, claims "the combination with the internal-combustion
engine of an automobile" of a specified friction-clutch. E claims
and illustrates only the friction-clutch. Should these be classified
together? If so, in what class? Should a bearing composed of a
specified alloy of copper, tin, and antimony, be classed as a bearing or
as an alloy? Should a house painted with a mixture of linseed oil,
lead oxid, and barium sulphate go to buildings or coating compositions?
A lamp-filament of titanium and zirconium with electric
lamps or with alloys? A building-block of cement, lime, sand,
and carborundum, with building-blocks or plastic compositions?
Whether these be diagnosed as combinations or as elements and
compositions respectively, and classified accordingly, criticism will
be aroused. The point in view is that although principles of patentability
must be considered in a classification designed as an instrument
to aid in determining patentability, convenience and accuracy of
search and avoidance of voluminous cross-referencing may necessitate
some arbitrary rule of classification to meet various and
changing theories applied to the drafting and allowance of claims.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be evident that classification involves
orderly logical processes of induction (supplemented by hypothesis),
of definition and of deduction. After gathering a large number of
facts generalizations are made from them and a hypothesis is found
to be confirmed or modified by more extended research; the divisions
are then defined; by correct diagnosis of other instances (as other
patents) deductions may be drawn respecting the appropriate place
for them in the classification.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> An "art," in the sense of a single unitary invention, is a synonym of process, method, and operation.
The term "art" is ambiguous in popular usage. In the phrase "useful arts" in the Constitution, it denotes
the area of endeavor to which the patent laws apply. When the word "art" is used to specify some fragment
of the useful arts, it commonly raises different notions in different minds. It may be correctly used
to designate <i>any</i> division of the useful arts. It is as proper to speak of the art of grinding or the art of
molding as of the art of metal-working or the art of brickmaking.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A "use" is an application of a means to substance to produce an effect which may or may not be the
necessary effect of the means in its normal operation. A catalytic may be used to ignite gas or to convert
oleins into stearines. An ice pick may be used to hold a chalk line or prick holes in leather, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> By "natural law" in the useful arts is meant that uniformity of action which is manifested whenever
any particular substance in any particular condition is brought into such relation with any particular
manifestation of energy that the force exerted modifies or prevents modification of the form, nature, condition,
or locus of the substance or modifies the manifestation of energy or both.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> A "property" may be described as any quality common and essential to the whole of a class but not
necessary to mark out that class from other classes. Thus, all wheel tires may be said to possess annularity;
but washers and finger rings are also annular. A "peculiar property" is one that not only always
belongs to a class of objects but belongs to that class alone; thus a circle has the peculiar property of containing
the greatest space within a line of given length, and catalytic substances have the power of setting
up chemical reaction without themselves being changed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> An "accident" is any quality that may indifferently belong or not belong to a class without affecting

physique or character.</p></div>

The effect of an instrument is the effect of its operation. Effects may be direct or indirect,

"Product" is an effect consequent upon a process that changes the form, state, or ingredients of matter
perceptibly and permanently, as distinguished from effects that are fleeting or involve no change in perceptible
form, state, or ingredients of matter.
</p><p>
"Function" is the "action of means upon an object while producing the effect." (Robinson.) Functions
may be direct or indirect, proximate or remote, necessary or accidental. The direct, proximate, or
necessary function of the hammer in normal operation is impacting. Indirect, remote, or accidental functions
of a hammer may be comminuting, forging, driving, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Any class of objects may be called a "genus" if it be regarded as made up of two or more different kinds
of objects or of two or more species. "Motors" is a genus when the class "Motors" is considered as divided
into electric motors and nonelectric motors, or electric motors, spring motors, weight motors, current motors
fluid pressure motors, etc. A genus is more extensive than any of its species but less intensive.
</p><p>
A "species" is any class that is regarded as forming a part of the next larger class, "electric motors"
being a species of "motors" and "motors" being a species of "energy transformers." A species is more
intensive than the genus to which it belongs but less extensive.
</p><p>
Every species may be a genus to another species until no further subdivisions can be made. This last
indivisible species is termed the <i>infima species</i>. Every genus may be a species to another genus until a
point is reached where no further generalization may be made or the <i>summum genus</i> is attained. In the
Patent Office classification of the useful arts, the <i>summum genus</i> is useful arts. The <i>summum genus</i>
of the plastic arts would be plastics. The <i>infima species</i> in the useful arts evidently never can be attained.
</p><p>
"Proximate species" and "proximate genus" indicate, respectively, those species that are divided from
a genus without intermediate genera, and those genera from which the species are directly divided. Motors,
and not energy transformers, is the proximate genus to the species, fluid motors, electric motors, etc., while
fluid motors, electric motors, etc., and not steam engines, alternating current motors, etc., are proximate

apparent that the species "Aluminum" and "Zinc" of the genus Metal would be as widely separated as
possible. In the former schedule of "Balls," in which the genus Metal is printed, "Aluminum" and
"Zinc" come together. It is apparent that in an alphabetical arrangement allied species can not be kept
together without printing every proximate genus. This fact, among others, indicates the advisability
of abandoning the alphabetical arrangement in the classification manual and adopting the idea arrangement
in the schedules of revised classes, supplemented by a consolidated alphabetical index of all subclasses.</p></div>

<h2 class="section"><a name="C" id="C"></a>(C) RULES OF CLASSIFICATION.</h2>

<h3 class="subsection">BASIS OF CLASSIFICATION.</h3>


<p><a name="Rule_1" id="Rule_1"></a>(1) The basis of subdivision and assemblage of the means of the
"useful arts" in the Patent Office classification is "art" within the
meaning of "art" in section 4886, Revised Statutes. The direct,
proximate or necessary art, operation or effect, rather than some
accidental and remote use or application, should be selected. In all
cases qualities or characteristics that persist through all accidental
uses and that can be identified as permanent are to be preferred.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_2" id="Rule_2"></a>(2) The operative, instrumental, or manipulative arts, including
machines, tools, and manufacturing processes, should be classified
according to whether a single operation of one kind applicable to
various materials to be used for various purposes is carried out by
the claimed means, or whether plural operations are performed,
which, combined, produce a special effect or special product.</p>

<p class="example">Example: An instrument performing a plurality of operations peculiar to shoe-manufacture
would be classified on the basis of shoemaking, because that instrument
would be incapable of other use, while an instrument peculiarly adapted to drive
nails would be classified on the basis of nailing, whether for nailing shoe-heels or other
objects, and a hammer would be classified on the basis of its function as an impact
tool even though described as for driving nails, and even into shoe-heels.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_3" id="Rule_3"></a>(3) Structures (passive instruments) will, in general, be classified
on the basis of structure, either of special or general application, the
essential functions and effects of static structures being resistive or
the maintaining of forces in equilibrium.</p>

<p class="example">Example: A structure recognized as peculiar to barriers of the kind known as
fences would be classified in the special class of Fences, but posts, joints, beams, etc.,
recognized as having use in general building, even though described as used in fences,
would be classified in a more general building class, such as Wooden Buildings or
Metallic Building Structures.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_4" id="Rule_4"></a>(4) Compositions of matter and manufactured or formed stock or
materials will be classified in accordance with the inherent character
of the substance or material where possible, otherwise according to
special use.</p>

<p class="example">Example: A pure chemical is expected to be classified on the basis of its chemical
structure and constituents, even though useful as a food, medicine, dyestuff, explosive,
etc., and alloys on the basis of metallic composition, even though used for bearings,
coins, tools, etc.; whereas a physical composition having no reason for existence
except to function as a cleansing composition or a paint might have to be classified
on the basis of its function as a detergent or a coating composition, respectively. Also
a bimetallic layered foil, plate, or wire would be expected to be classified as metal
stock even though designed for use for dental filler, plowshare, or electric conductor,
and a woven textile fabric as a fabric even though described as used for a filter or
apron for a paper-making machine.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">p. 27</a></span></p>


<h4 class="subsection">DIVISION AND ARRANGEMENT.</h4>

<p><a name="Rule_5" id="Rule_5"></a>(5) The divisions or subclasses of a class should be made exhaustive,
i. e., they should be susceptible of receiving any future invention
that may fall within the scope of the class. The rule as
usually phrased is: "The constituent species must be equal, when
added together, to the genus." Exhaustive division may be secured
by maintaining always a residual or miscellaneous subclass. The
miscellaneous subclass represents the remainder of the original undivided
material undefined except as the class is defined and may be
accurately treated as if it had the class title.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_6" id="Rule_6"></a>(6) A second rule respecting the subdivision of a class is: "The
constituent species must exclude each other." That is, the divisions
or subclasses must not overlap. (See exception in Rule <a href="#Rule_8">8</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: If a number of balls of several different materials, several different conformations,
or constructions, several different colors, were to be divided into glass balls,
hollow balls, and red balls, this rule would be violated, because some balls would be
glass, hollow, and red.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_7" id="Rule_7"></a>(7) A third rule respecting subdivision is: "The divisions must be
founded on one principle or basis." The application of this rule will
generally form divisions that do not overlap. (See exception in
Rule <a href="#Rule_8">8</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: If a number of balls of several different constructions, several different
materials, and several different colors were to be classified so as to provide a place for
each kind of characteristic, they should be divided first, for example, according to construction
into hollow balls and solid balls, each of these according to materials into
glass balls, rubber balls, metal balls, wooden balls, etc., and each of the latter into red
balls, blue balls, green balls, etc.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_8" id="Rule_8"></a>(8) When it is found that division into overlapping subclasses and
on different characteristics is a lesser evil than an unwieldy number
of subclasses that would otherwise result, then those subclasses based
on characteristics deemed more important for purposes of search
should precede in the list of subclasses those based upon characteristics
deemed less important. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_6">6</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="Rule_9" id="Rule_9"></a>(9) In arrangement of subclasses or subdivisions the miscellaneous
groups containing material not falling within any of the specifically
entitled subclasses, should stand first; those subclasses defined by
effect or special use should precede those defined by function or
general use; those containing matter that is related to the matter of
other subclasses as whole to part should precede those subclasses
that contain the part; and those defined by a characteristic deemed
more important or significant for search purposes should precede
those defined by characteristics deemed less important.</p>

<p><i>Whenever superior rank has been assigned to any selected characteristic</i>
by placing divisions based upon it in advance of divisions based<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">p. 28</a></span>
upon other characteristics, <i>this superiority should be maintained
throughout</i>.</p>


<p class="example">Example: A partial schedule of Class 80 follows to illustrate the arrangement of
subclasses:</p>

<p class="example">In this schedule the miscellaneous subclass is numbered 1, then follow three subclasses
(2-4) of rolling plus another function, then four major subclasses (5-16) of
rolling, merely, but applied to blanks of special form producing special products,
then one special subclass (17) based upon a special class of material treated, then five
subclasses (18-31) specialized in type and mode of operation, then general types of
rolling mills (32-40), then various parts and accessories (41-59), then processes (60-66).
This is the usual arrangement and is an exhaustive division for the art of metal rolling.
Had there been miscellaneous subclasses for all combined operations of rolling plus
some other function, a miscellaneous subclass for all mere rolling machines, either
special or general, and a miscellaneous subclass for all parts and accessories, the
requirements of exhaustive division would have been also satisfied.</p>

<p class="example">In the illustrative schedule, there being no miscellaneous subclass for means having
combined functions of rolling and another, any patent having claims for the combination
of a means for rolling and a means for cooling would fall in subclass 1, Miscellaneous.
In that subclass would also fall all "Mills," such as for rolling spiral conveyer-flights,
the same not falling under any of the subclasses 32-40, no miscellaneous subclass
of "Mills" and no special article-rolling subclass having been provided; also
all parts or accessories, such as a water-cooled screen, peculiarly adapted to rolling-mills,
there being no existing subclass of screens therein and no miscellaneous subclass
of parts. The arrangement of subclasses in Class 80 requires that the combination
of a furnace and a rolling-mill shall be placed in subclass 2, even if the combination
be designed and adapted for rolling annular bodies (subclass 5) or tubes (subclass 11).
Means special to rolling a tube between a concave and roll must be placed in subclass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">p. 29</a></span>
13 rather than in subclass 18. A work-reversing mill must be placed in subclass 33
rather than in subclass 34 even though it have three or more coacting rolls.</p>

<p class="example">The rolling of "Screw-threads" having been given higher rank than a "Concave
and roll" mechanism, any concave and roll mechanism limited for use in rolling
screw-threads should be formed into a subclass indented under "Screw-threads"
and not into a subclass "Screw-threads" indented under "Concave and roll."</p>

<p><a name="Rule_10" id="Rule_10"></a>(10) Class schedules are arranged with certain subclasses appropriately
indented according to a commonly understood expedient.
In a properly indented schedule subclasses in column at the extreme
left are the main species (the proximate species) of the class. The
titles and definitions of all subclasses proximate to the class (at
extreme left) must be read with the title and definition of the class,
as if indented under the class title one space to the right; so also
with the titles and definitions of subclasses indented under other
subclasses. If a title has no number (as in Class 80, "Mills"), it represents
merely a subject-matter to be divided, assumed to have no
representatives other than those in the species indented under it.
If a title having indented species under it has a number, it not only
represents a subject to be divided but also a subclass including all
other species not falling within the indented titles. Indention does
not indicate superiority or inferiority, but merely that the title and
the definition of the indented subclass must be read with the title
and definition of the subclass under which it is indented. A title
selected in a scheme of subdivision to be of first importance and
placed, therefore, in advance, should not thereafter be indented under
a title selected to be of secondary importance and, therefore, having
a lower position. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_8">8</a>.)</p>

<p><a name="Rule_11" id="Rule_11"></a>(11) A group of material may be divided on several different bases.
"Use" or "purpose" or "object treated" may be adopted only
when the "use" or "purpose" or "object treated" stamps upon the
invention such peculiarities of operation or construction as to limit
the applicability of the invention to the use or purpose named.
(See Basis of Classification, Rule <a href="#Rule_1">1</a>.) A group based upon mode of
operation also may be divided into subclasses (1) with a "functional"
title, usually participial in form, and adapted therefore to receive
machines, processes, and tools; (2) with special use, purpose, or
object-treated title containing the name of the use, purpose, or
object; (3) with "type" title, usually a name or a name with a qualifying
adjective; (4) with a title of a part or subcombination, also a
name.</p>

<p class="example">Example: In Class 90, Gear-Cutting, Milling, and Planing, are to be found subclasses
entitled "Gear-cutting," certain machines being peculiar to that use; also
other subclasses with the general functional title "Planing," subordinate to which
are the special use subclass "Planing, Soft metal," and the type subclass "Planers"
divided into two coordinate subclasses, "Reciprocating bed" and "Reciprocating
cutter," and several subordinate "part" subclasses, including "Tool-feeds" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">p. 30</a></span>
"Tool-heads." The adjective form of the title "Planers, Reciprocating bed," indicates
a type subclass. If the title had been Planers, Reciprocating beds, the indication
would be that the subclass was a part subclass to receive planer beds only. In
the class referred to for illustration, "Tool-feeds" and "Tool-heads" indicate subclasses
for parts and not for types of planers having tool feeds.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_12" id="Rule_12"></a>(12) In arranging the divisions of a class, such arrangement should
be sought as will minimize the need of cross-references. Search for
any particular matter can not always be limited to one group without
such extensive cross-referencing as would in some cases defeat the
purpose of classification. Forming the subdivisions of a class according
to the total similarities of the inventions, rather than according
to some selected more or less important characteristic, and arranging
them in the correct order of superiority and inferiority, with care to
maintain throughout the schedule the relative positional values of
the several selected bases of division, will ordinarily in a closely
bonded class limit the search for any single invention to the subclass
particularly suited to receive it and some subclasses preceding that
one, excluding from the necessity of search the subclasses succeeding.</p>

<p class="example">Example: In Class 80, Metal-Rolling, it would not be expected to find any tube-rolling
mill lower in the schedule than the tube-rolling subclasses, but a tube-mill
might be found higher up in "Heating and rolling," "Drawing and rolling," etc.
No concave and roll combination should be found succeeding the subclass of "Concave
and roll," but it may be found under subclasses above, such as "Tubes, Screw-threads,"
etc. No rolls should be found lower than the subclass of "Rolls," but
they may be found in many subclasses above.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">DEFINITION.</h4>

<p><a name="Rule_13" id="Rule_13"></a>(13) Having some knowledge of the nature of the materials about
to be classified, a tentative definition of a class to be formed may be
framed, which may be either written down or merely carried in
mind, to serve as a tentative guide. This tentative definition
must be considered as subject to change to any extent by the fuller
knowledge obtained by careful consideration of the material. After
a full knowledge of the materials to be classified has been acquired,
it will be necessary to frame a careful definition of the class, and
also of each subclass whose title does not unequivocally indicate
what is contained in it.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_14" id="Rule_14"></a>(14) A definition of any class should state the "qualities and
circumstances possessed by all the objects that are intended to be
included in the class and not possessed completely by any other
objects." A proper definition should not ordinarily contain the
name of the thing defined. "Definitions in a circle" are, of course,
worthless. A definition should be exactly equivalent to the species
defined and should not be expressed in obscure or ambiguous language,
but should employ terms already defined or perfectly understood.
It should not be in negative form where it can be affirmative. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">p. 31</a></span>
the class of objects has a peculiar property, the naming of that may
serve as a definition. If no peculiar property can be detected, the
definition should name more than one quality or property. Several
different classes may have one or more properties alike, but as the
number is increased the likelihood of there being others having the
same properties is decreased. The briefest possible statement of
such properties or qualities as are possessed by all the objects of a
class and not completely possessed by any other objects, which will
suffice to distinguish the class from other classes and determine its
position in the general classification, will be most satisfactory. To
define any species, the genus having been defined, the genus should
be named and the difference added. Of course, no generic definition
should contain any limitation not characteristic of every species
of the defined genus. In seeking qualities by which to describe a
genus or species, no accident should be selected.</p>

<p class="example">Example: Suppose there be marked out and defined as a genus all means whereby
one form of energy is transformed into another form of energy and no more, and the
genus be named energy-transformers. We may then name, as species, energy-transformers
that are motors and energy-transformers that are not motors. Motors may be
defined by merely naming the genus energy-transformers, and stating the difference,
to wit, continuously transforming energy into cyclical mechanical motion. Then the
definition will be: Energy-transformers that are adapted to continuously transform
energy into cyclical mechanical motion. The non-motor division will retain the genus
definition.</p>

<p class="example">It would not be illuminating for a searcher having little familiarity with the textile
arts to look under the title "Carding" and find that carding is defined as a means for
carding fiber.</p>

<p class="example">Even though the first steam-engine invented had been used to run a gristmill, the
accident of its use as a part of a gristmill would hardly warrant the definition of a
steam-engine as a means to grind corn. Nor would a hammer be properly defined as
an instrument to drive nails or to crack nuts or to forge horseshoes, even though a
patent should not mention any use other than one of these and should lay heavy
emphasis on the special value of the hammer as a nut cracker, nail driver, etc.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_15" id="Rule_15"></a>(15) In those cases where the title is so obvious that definition is
superfluous, explanatory notes may be substituted and will usually
be found helpful.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">CROSS-REFERENCES AND SEARCH-NOTES.</h4>

<p><a name="Rule_16" id="Rule_16"></a>(16) Inasmuch as nearly every patent discloses unclaimed matter
that is classifiable separately from the claimed matter, it is clearly
impossible to cross-reference every disclosure of every means in every
patent. Many things must be taken as conventional, obvious, or
well known, and the good judgment of the classifier is bound to be
exercised in cross-referencing matter disclosed but not claimed to be
the invention of the patentee.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_17" id="Rule_17"></a>(17) A mere part or element should rarely be cross-referenced
from an element class to a superior combination class. An element<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">p. 32</a></span>
forming part of a combination in a superior class should, if claimed,
be cross-referenced to the element class and also if not claimed if it
seems to be not merely a conventional form, and patents having
claims for more than one differently classifiable invention should
always be cross-referenced unless such an arrangement of subclasses
with search-notes is substituted as will guide the searcher to all
places where the material may be found. Claimed matter additional
to that which controls the classification, if belonging in the same class,
should be cross-referenced into a <i>succeeding</i> subclass. Cross-references
of unclaimed disclosure may be in either direction.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_18" id="Rule_18"></a>(18) To supplement or take the place of cross-referencing, more or
less elaborate search-notes are needed, giving directions and suggestions
for further search, setting out the relationship between classes
and subclasses, and drawing distinctions by example. Search-notes
should indicate other classes or subclasses in which the subject-matter
of the group to which the search-notes are appended is likely
to form a part of a more intensive combination, also analogous matter
that might serve as a reference for a broad claim. They need not,
in general, indicate where parts or elements of the subject-matter
which are common also to other classes can be found, because the
index of classes contains the necessary information. For example, it
is not necessary in every machine-class to indicate by search-notes
where machine-elements and static parts may be found, nor in a class
of wooden boxes to point out where the nails, screws, hinges, or
locks that may form a part of the box are classified.</p>


<h4 class="subsection">DIAGNOSIS TO DETERMINE CLASSIFICATION.</h4>

<p><a name="Rule_19" id="Rule_19"></a>(19) Inasmuch as nearly every patent contains disclosure that is
claimed and also disclosure that is not claimed, it has been deemed
advisable to establish the general rule that where the claimed and
unclaimed disclosures are classified in different classes or subclasses
the invention both disclosed and claimed shall determine the placing
of a patent (or a pending application) rather than any selected invention
that may be disclosed but not claimed. "Not claimed" covers
means that may form an element only of a claim as well as means not
referred to in any claim. (See exceptions in Rules <a href="#Rule_21">21</a> to <a href="#Rule_22">22</a> inclusive.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent discloses and claims a dash-pot but illustrates it in such relation
to a metal-planing machine as to utilize it for checking the movement of the bed at
one end of its path, or in connection with an electric generator to aid in effecting the
brush adjustment; the patent should be classified in the subclass of Dash-pots. If
the classifier finds the disclosed organization of dash-pots and planer or dash-pot and
generator more than a conventional illustration of an obvious use, he should note a
cross-reference to Planers or Electricity, Generation. A patent discloses an internal-combustion
engine associated with a specific form of carbureter; the claims relate
to the engine parts only; the class of Internal-Combustion Engines should receive
the patent, and a cross-reference should be placed in Carbureters. A patent discloses
and specifically claims the combination of a rail-joint comprising abutting rails, fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">p. 33</a></span>plates,
and specific bolts; the patent goes to an appropriate class of rail-joints, and
if the bolt is more than a mere obvious conventional bolt, a cross-reference should be
noted for the appropriate subclass of Bolts.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_20" id="Rule_20"></a>(20) The totality of the claimed invention should be selected when
possible to determine the appropriate class in which to place a patent.
The entire expression of the invention will usually be set forth in the
most relatively intensive claim.<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In a properly drawn patent there
is at least one claim that will serve as a mark to indicate the classification
of that patent.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_21" id="Rule_21"></a>(21) Where a patent discloses but does not claim a combination
of proper scope to be classified in a combination subclass and claims
merely a detail classified in a subclass lower in the schedule, both in
the same class, if the subclasses are so related that the combination
always involves the detail so that a search for the detail must necessarily
be made in the combination subclass, the patent may be placed
in the combination subclass. This avoids the need of a cross reference
into the combination subclass, and a lack of a copy in the detail
subclass is immaterial, as it is seen in the completion of the search
through the combination subclass. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent for a saw-making machine discloses dressing, jointing, and
gaging mechanisms; it claims dressing and jointing only. There is a subclass for
dressing, jointing, and gaging, and a subclass for dressing and jointing. In this case
the patent may be placed in the first-mentioned subclass, as that must be searched
always when the second-mentioned one is searched, cross referencing in this situation
being of little value.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_22" id="Rule_22"></a>(22) Where a subclass with a generic title has indented thereunder
a species type-subclass bearing the title of the generic subclass
qualified by a difference, any patent which claims an invention falling
within the genus subclass and discloses the qualification of the
species type-subclass should be classified in the latter whether or not
the entire disclosure is claimed. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example:</p>

<div class="ctrclass">
<p class="example">
<span style="margin-left: 3em">Class 29.&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">Metal Working.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em">Machine chucks and tool sockets&mdash;</span><br />

</p>
</div>


<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">p. 34</a></span></p>

<p class="example">If a patent claimed only the scroll of a scroll-chuck, but disclosed it in connection
with a bevel pinion and ring, it should be classified in subclass 127, Bevel pinion and
ring, and not in subclass 126, Scroll, although if there were no disclosure of the bevel
pinion and ring it would go in subclass 126. Any search for scrolls must be prosecuted
through all subclasses that include "Scroll" in the title.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_23" id="Rule_23"></a>(23) Where, as in the case of patents that show and claim a combination
that as matter of common knowledge is not new except in one
of its elements, to classify a patent strictly in accordance with rule
would result in placing the patent where it would serve no useful purpose
as a reference and having to cross-reference it to a class where
it would serve a useful purpose, it is best to classify the patent in
the class to which the element would take it. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent claiming a wheeled vehicle, broadly, in combination with an
internal-combustion engine comprising a cylinder, a crank-case, a piston and suitably-connected
crank, a valve opening into the crank-case, and a valve in the piston opening
into the cylinder, may be advantageously classified as an internal-combustion
engine notwithstanding the alleged invention is for a motor vehicle.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_24" id="Rule_24"></a>(24) In order to meet the situation respecting the classification
of those patents that indiscriminately claim an article of manufacture
defined only by the material of which it is made and those patents
that claim those materials, leaving to the specification information
regarding the designed uses, patents for articles defined only by their
ingredients specifically set forth may be placed in the composition
of matter or material class. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent having a claim for a cutter made of an alloy of iron, tungsten,
and manganese would be classified with Alloys; a patent claiming a box made of
paper composed of two layers united by a solution of asphaltum should go to the class
of Laminated Fabric and Analogous Manufactures, rather than to paper boxes; and
a patent for a house having its exterior coated with equal quantities by volume of
carbonate of lead and oxid of barium suspended in a vehicle of linseed-oil would be
classified as a paint rather than as a house.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_25" id="Rule_25"></a>(25) An alleged process of utilizing a specifically-defined composition
or material which consists in merely applying it to the use it
was designed for may be classified as a composition or material
rather than as a process. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A process of painting the bottom of a marine vessel which consists in
applying thereto a composition consisting of sulphate of copper, powdered metallic
zinc, chlorid of antimony, and hyposulphite of soda, in a vehicle of linseed oil,
would be more usefully classified as an antifouling paint than as a ship, as the invention
would hardly be distinguishable from a paint claimed as such and described for
use on submarine surfaces.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_26" id="Rule_26"></a>(26) An alleged process consisting merely in the use of a particularly-defined
machine or similar instrument operating according to
its law of action will ordinarily be classified in the class or subclass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">p. 35</a></span>
where the machine belongs. But if in addition to defining the operation
of a particular machine the claim also specifies acts not performed
by the machine, the classification should be in the class or
subclass in which the process belongs. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_19">19</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: Thus a claim for a method of rolling an iron plate which consists in passing
an iron blank between a pair of rolls arranged horizontally in juxtaposition one
above the other and geared together so as to rotate in opposite directions, and causing
an idle roll supported in bearings on the roll-housings to bear against the central
portion of the surface of one of the first pair of rolls on the upper side thereof, should
be classified as a rolling-mill, while if to that claim were added the steps of doubling
the sheet after one passage between the rolls, again passing between the rolls, again
doubling, and then passing the now four-ply pack between the rolls sidewise or turned
90 per cent to the direction in which it had previously been fed, the classification
should be with processes of sheet-metal manufacture.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_27" id="Rule_27"></a>(27) In the absence of settled rules defining permissible joinder of
inventions, there may be in one patent claims for one or more or all
of the classes of invention named in the statute, to wit, machine, art,
manufacture, and composition of matter. There may also be claims
to several more or less related inventions in the same statutory class
of invention but each belonging to a different industrial art. (1)
Where different main classes are involved, the patent will be classified
by the most intensive invention, without regard to the statutory
class to which it belongs. (2) Where different subclasses of the same
class are involved, the patent will be classified in that one of the several
subclasses defined to receive the several inventions which stands
highest in the schedule of subclasses.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_28" id="Rule_28"></a>(28) Where a patent contains claims for all or a plurality less than
all of the statutory classes, the general rule of preference or superiority
of the several classes of subclasses is that represented by the
following order, to wit: (1) Machine (or other operative instrument);
(2) Art; (3) Manufacture; (4) Composition of matter. This order
is, in a general way, the order of intensiveness of the several kinds of
invention. (See Rules <a href="#Rule_29">29</a>-<a href="#Rule_35">35</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: An automatic screw-machine, peculiarly adapted to carry out a process
of making a novel form of machine-screw out of a new iron alloy, and having a claim
to the machine, to the process, to the screw, and to the alloy, would be assigned to
Metal-Working, Combined machines, and, if all claims were allowed, cross-referenced
to Bolt and rivet-making processes, to Bolts, and to Alloys. If the claim to any one
or two of the subjects were eliminated, the order of preference or superiority and the
order of cross-referencing would remain the same.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_29" id="Rule_29"></a>(29) Patents containing a plurality of claims for several different
statutory kinds of invention that are classifiable in different main
classes, and wherein the rule of relative intensiveness varies from the
order Machine, Art, Manufacture, and Composition of matter, may
be diagnosed and classified as directed in the following paragraphs
(<a href="#Rule_30">30</a> to <a href="#Rule_35">35</a>).</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">p. 36</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Rule_30" id="Rule_30"></a>(30) Where a patent contains claims for a process and for an apparatus
susceptible of use as an instrument in carrying out the process,
but not peculiar to that use, or for an apparatus adapted to carry out
but one step or only a part of the process, the process claim, being in
this instance the more intensive, would control the classification.
(See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: In a patent containing a claim for a process of roasting ore and then collecting
the fumes, and another claim for a roasting furnace that is a mere material-heating
furnace, the process claim would control; whereas, if one claim were for a method
of roasting ores consisting of stirring the ore, applying heat to the same, and collecting
the solids from the fumes, and the other claim, were for a heating furnace having a
stirrer and a fume arrester, the apparatus claim would control. And if a patent contained
claims for a process of roasting ores, and other claims for a furnace susceptible
of use in carrying out the process but equally useful in annealing glass or steel articles,
the process claim would control.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_31" id="Rule_31"></a>(31) Where a patent claims a specified article of manufacture or
other product, and also an instrument for making a part only of that
specified article or other product, the product claim, being more
intensive, should control the classification; so also in case of a claim
for a product and a claim for an instrument performing any minor
act with respect thereto. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: Where a patent claims a particular construction of a riveted joint, and
also a tool for calking the rivet, and where a patent claims a particular construction of
shoe, and also a buttonhook for buttoning said shoe, the article and not the tool claims
control.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_32" id="Rule_32"></a>(32) Where a patent contains claims to a process and a product,
the process claims govern the classification in those cases where search
among machines for making the product would have to be made, and
such processes would be classifiable on the basis of the mode of operation,
usually in the same class with machines for practicing such
processes. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent having a claim for a process of making bifocal lenses, consisting
in grinding the surface of one piece of glass to form a convex lens, heating another piece
of glass until it is plastic, then forcing the ground surface of the first-named piece into
the body of the latter and gradually cooling the lens-blank thus formed; and also a
claim for a bifocal lens composed of two pieces of glass weld-united, would be classified
in Glass-manufacture and cross-referenced into lenses. Or a patent having a claim
to a process of making a metal plate with elongated perforations, consisting in forming
round perforations in the plate and subsequently rolling the plate, thereby thinning
and elongating the plate and elongating the openings, and also a claim to a metallic
plate having relatively long and narrow perforations, would be classified on the basis
of the process claim.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_33" id="Rule_33"></a>(33) Where a patent claims both process and product, and the
alleged process is disclosed in the product, so that search would have
to be made in the appropriate class of products, the product will be
adopted as the basis of classification, and classification will be in
the appropriate product class. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">p. 37</a></span></p>

<p class="example">Example: A claim for a process of making a pencil consisting in assembling a core
of graphite with a sheathing of wood, and attaching a cap of rubber-composition to
one end, would be classified as a pencil rather than as a process, became conception
of the article is inseparable from the process and search must be made in the article
class.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_34" id="Rule_34"></a>(34) Where a patent claims a process of making a composition of
matter, and also the composition of matter, the claims will be classified
in general in accordance with the classification of the composition
of matter in all cases where the process is peculiarly adapted to
produce the composition, as by setting forth the introduction or
assemblage of particular ingredients, since those processes that
include the selection of particular ingredients necessitate search
among compositions having such ingredients. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: A patent having a claim for a composition consisting of a mixture of
caoutchouc and casein, and a claim for the process of preparing a rubberlike substance
which consists in adding undissolved raw caoutchouc to casein and thoroughly
mixing and kneading the mass, would be classified according to the composition.</p>

<p><a name="Rule_35" id="Rule_35"></a>(35) Where a patent claims a product such as a specific article
of manufacture, or a specific composition of matter, and also claims
a process of general application for making one of the parts of the
article or one of the ingredients of the composition, the product
claim should control the classification. (See Rule <a href="#Rule_28">28</a>.)</p>

<p class="example">Example: If a patent claimed a woven textile fabric having the yarns interlaced
in a defined relation, and a process of spinning a yarn utilized in the fabric; or if a
patent claimed a varnish composed of shellac, dissolved in wood alcohol, and a pigment,
and also contained a claim for distilling wood to obtain the alcohol, the product
claim would control the classification in each instance, and the process would be
cross-referenced.</p>

possessed by objects bearing that name. The term "motors" in extension means all motors&mdash;electric,
gas, water, spring, weight, etc. "Motors" in intension means instruments to convert some form
or manifestation of energy into periodical or cyclical motion of a body. As the intension increases the extension
decreases, and vice versa. There must be more motors than there are electric motors, and electric
motors have more qualifications than are common to all motors. Comparison of arts and instruments with
respect to their extension and intension for classification purposes should be made between comparable
qualities. A claim for a steam-engine may be very specific while a claim for a reaper may be very broad;
here there is no comparable relationship, and the terms intensive and extensive do not have the relative
significance most useful in classification. But when a patent or application contains claims for mechanism
peculiar to electric motors and other claims for mechanism common to electric motors and other kinds of
motors, the claims for the electric motor would control the classification.</p></div>

<h2 class="section"><a name="D" id="D"></a>(D) PROCEDURE IN RECLASSIFYING WITHIN EXAMINING DIVISIONS.</h2>


<p>(1) Do not start to make a new class or revise an old one with preconceived
fixed notions respecting its scope and the particular subdivisions
required. Wait until all patents pertinent to the subject
have been seen and adequate knowledge of them acquired. In other
words, make no <i>a priori</i> classification but discover and assemble all
the facts and from them make your inductions. Then the common
characteristics of the subject-matter of the class may be intelligently
defined, the limitations of the class marked out, and its relation to
other classes set forth. Bear in mind that the Patent Office classification
deals with the subject-matter of the useful arts rather than
merely with existing classes, and that it is not therefore essential to
retain classes that are found to be composed of unrelated or too
distantly related units.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">p. 38</a></span></p>

<p>Assuming that the work of reclassification is undertaken by examiners
who are already experienced in the subject-matter to be classified,
procedure as follows is recommended:</p>

<p>(2) Utilizing your previously acquired knowledge of the patents in
the class you are about to revise, subdivide the existing subclasses
into bundles, so as to assemble in each bundle those patents deemed
to have the closest resemblance to each other. For the purpose of
this assemblage, consider each patent as an entirety and not with
reference to various more or less important parts of that entirety.</p>

<p class="example">Example: An apparatus comprising in alleged combination a means for decanting
water, a means for electrolytically depositing impurities, and a means for filtering the
water, should not be classified either as a decanter, an electrolytic apparatus, or a
filter, but should be classified as a combination apparatus (taking it to the general art
of liquid purification). So also the combination of a rotary printing-press with a
folding mechanism, and a wrapping mechanism, should not be classified merely as a
rotary printing-press, a folding machine, or a wrapping machine, but should be
classified as a combination of the several mechanisms as an entirety whose functions
carried out in proper order produce a printed and wrapped newspaper.</p>

<p>(3) Write an approximate or tentative definition of the matter
thus assembled in each bundle and attach it to its appropriate
bundle.</p>

<p>(4) Where it appears that the subject matter of any bundle formed
from the patents of any subclass is analogous to matter in other subclasses
of the same class or in other classes, a note should be added
to that effect so that this matter may be given special consideration.</p>

<p>(5) When the same examiner or different examiners are working
on different subclasses containing analogous matter, parallel lines of
subdivision should be followed wherever possible, in order to effect
an arrangement that will facilitate comparisons.</p>

<p>(6) When subdividing a group of more or less complex organized
structures or mechanisms, note should be taken of subcombinations
that form or it is thought should form the basis of other subclasses,
either in the same or different classes, into which those details may be
collected, either classified therein originally or by cross-reference.</p>

<p class="example">Example: Assuming that the combination of press, folder, and wrapping mechanism,
referred to in a preceding paragraph is to be classified in a class of Printing, on
the entirety as a combination having the function of printing, plus other functions,
and that folding and also wrapping are separately classified, then the particular type
of press should be selected to be cross-referenced into a press-type subclass of the class
of Printing, such as "Presses, rotary," while the folding mechanism and the wrapping
mechanism would be noted for cross-reference to other appropriate classes. Also,
any part of the printing press, such as the inking mechanism, specifically described,
should be noted for cross-reference into a subclass of Printing designed to receive the
inking mechanism as a part of the printing press.</p>

<p>(7) After a knowledge of the material of the class has been obtained
by estimating the resemblances between the individual patents that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">p. 39</a></span>
have been assembled in the several groups, comparison of these groups,
represented by the bundles of photolithographs, by the aid of the
approximate definitions and notes attached can be made. It can
then be decided whether all of these groups are to be retained in the
proposed class, and the retained groups can be organized into a class
with the subclasses arranged so as to bring those subclasses having
the strongest resemblances in closest relation, and in such order as to
comply with the conventions adopted in the official classification.
It will probably be necessary to have one subclass or group as broad
as the definition of the class, to take unclassifiable matter and to
provide for possible future inventions.</p>

<p>(8) Up to this point, more or less cursory attention may be given
individual patents; but when an arrangement of subclasses shall have
been tentatively adopted it will be necessary to consider each patent
carefully to ascertain whether it is properly placed.</p>

<p>(9) Patents that, considered as an entirety, cover means not
peculiar to the class or subject-matter being revised, should, in general,
when assembled in groups as indicated, have a note attached indicating
not only want of limitation to the subject-matter of the class
but also a more appropriate class to receive them if such there be.
Although a very large proportion of patents can be accurately classified
as indicated by their titles and stated uses, the mere fact that in a
patent found in a class the invention is called in the specification or
claims by a name peculiar to the class is not of itself a reason for considering
it peculiar to the class. A gas and liquid contact apparatus
may be called a heater, a cooler, a gas-washer, a water-carbonator, a
condenser, a disinfecter, an air-moistener, and so on, depending upon
accident of use. If there are not elements in some claim to confine
the means described distinctively to what it is called, or if there are
no functions necessarily implied in the means claimed peculiar to the
named use, the patent should not be kept in the class unless there is
no other class in the office that can receive it.</p>

<p class="example">Example: Where the matter claimed is a metal beam of peculiar cross-section, it
should be classified with other metal beams, as in Class 189, Metallic Building Structures,
even if it is named in the application as a beam of particular use, as a railroad-tie,
car-sill, bridge-tie, etc. Should a mere dash-pot be found classified in Class 171,
Electricity, Generation, a note should be attached indicating that it belongs in the
appropriate element class.</p>

<p>(10) In giving this final careful attention to the patents, each
should also be scanned to see whether it contains matter that should
be cross-referenced. A few lines obscurely located in a specification
may contain a disclosure of a most valuable invention. No class
can be deemed complete until the disclosures appropriate to it found
as parts of more complex inventions in other classes, or disclosures
of analogous matter in other classes, are either cross-referenced into
it or cross search-notes made.</p>
<p class="pn"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">p. 40</a></span></p>

<p>(11) To indicate cross-references, from one subclass to another
within the class or from the class under consideration into another
class, attach a small slip of paper to the patent and mark on the slip
the subclass number in which the cross-reference shall be mounted.
If the matter to be cross-referenced relates only to a portion of a
voluminous patent, the portion of the specification and drawing to
be cross-referenced should be indicated. If the cross-reference
falls outside the class, the class number should be noted in addition
to the subclass number.</p>

<p>(12) Should it be found that the handling of copies in making
examinations detaches the cross-reference slips, it may be advisable
to mark lightly but legibly in pencil on the lower right-hand corner
of the examiner's photolithograph the number of the subclass or
subclasses into which it is to be cross-referenced, or the number of
the class and subclass in case it is to be cross-referenced to another
class.</p>

<p>(13) Whether cross-reference notations are written on a separate
slip or on the photolithograph, the number of the class and subclass
into which a patent is to be cross-referenced should always be preceded
by X (thus X 101-23) in order to distinguish the original
classification notation from the cross-reference notation and enable
sorting and indexing to be done without confusion.</p>

<p>(14) To indicate cross-references from other classes into the one
being reclassified, set down the number of the patent in a notebook,
placing after the number (1) the class and subclass in which it is
classified; and (2) the number of the class and subclass in which it
is to be cross-referenced.</p>

<p>(15) Should new subclasses be formed or transfers of patents be
determined on, and lists of the patents, instead of copies thereof,
be furnished clerks for the purpose of making such subclasses and
transfers and correcting the official indexes and other records, each
patent should be listed by number in column to the left of a sheet of
paper or notebook, and opposite each patent number on the same
sheet should be written (1) the number of the class and subclass in
which it is officially classified; (2) the number of the class and subclass
to which it is intended to transfer it; and (3) the numbers of
the classes and subclasses, preceded by X, into which it is intended
to cross-reference it.</p>

<p class="example">Note: Even though examiners engaged in reclassifying are confident of their ability
to classify and arrange on better principles than those that have been applied thus
far in the classification, they ought, nevertheless, to follow those principles under
which one-half of the patents have been classified. Until the Commissioner of
Patents orders examiners to classify on other principles, it is expected they will
follow those now established.</p>
